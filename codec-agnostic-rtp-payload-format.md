Introduction
============

The objective of this spec is to create a generic RTP packetization format that can be used with any video codec or encrypted content and that allows SFUs to perform layer selection without requiring access to the codec payload.

RTP packetization
=======================

A generic packetizer, by design, is not expected to understand the format of the media to transmit.
The unit used by the packetizer to do processing is called a frame in the remainder of the document.

It is the responsibility of the application using the packetizer to group media content in meaningful frames.
In the common case of a video codec, the packetizer frame is the frame in byte format (h264 annex b for example) generated by the encoder.
The packetizer can fragment, in a content-agnostic way, the frame in multiple RTP packets to ensure packets do not exceed the network maximum transmission unit.

In the case of a video codec supporting spatial scalability, each spatial layer is split in its own frame.
The spatial layers are sent in ascending order, with the same RTP timestamp, and only the last RTP packet of the last spatial layer frame will have the marker bit set to 1.

If the application wants to encrypt content, the application will split media content into frames before encryption.
Each frame will be encrypted independently, using {{SFrame}} for instance, and transmitted by the packetizer.

Layer selection
=======================

The information required to perform the layer selection on an SFU is included in the Dependency descriptor which is available to SFUs even if the payload is encrypted.

SDP negotiation
=======================
Each video format will require a different payload type so they can be negotiated by both peers.

fmtp codec includes the FOURCC of the codec.

no need to negotiate the standard packetization for each coded, they are independent

rtx and fec are negotiated normally

Q: should we define what are the negotiated parameters for each codec? should we reuse mpeg/dash ones?
