Introduction
============

The objective of this spec is to create a generic RTP packetization format that can be used with any audio or video codec or encrypted content and that allows SFUs to perform routing and layer selection without requiring access to the codec payload.

RTP packetization
=======================

A generic packetizer, by design, is not expected to understand the format of the media to transmit. The unit used by the packetizer to do processing is called a frame in the remainder of the document.

It is the responsibility of the application using the packetizer to group media content in meaningful frames. In the common case of a video codec, the packetizer frame is the frame in byte format (h264 annex b for example) generated by the encoder. 

When the packetizer receives a frame from the application, it MUST fragment the frame content in multiple RTP packets to ensure packets do not exceed the network maximum transmission unit. The content of the frame will be treated as a binary blob by the packetizer, so the decision about the boundaries of each fragment is decided arbitrarily by the packetizer. The packetizer MUST NOT modify the frame content and the concatenating the RTP payload of the RTP packets for each frame MUST produce the exact binary content of the input frame content.

In the case of a video codec supporting spatial scalability, each spatial layer MUST be split in its own frame by the application before passing it to the packetizer. 
The spatial layer frames are sent in ascending order, with the same RTP timestamp, and only the last RTP packet of the last spatial layer frame will have the marker bit set to 1.

If the application wants to encrypt content, the application needs to split media content into frames before encryption as explained above and, using {{SFrame}} for example, encrypt each frame content independently. The content of each encrypted frame will then be fed to the packetizer.


Layer selection
=======================

SFUs need to have a basic understanding of each frame they receive so they can decide to forward it or not and to which endpoint.
They might need similar information to support media content recording.
This information is either generic to a group of frame (called a stream hereafter) or specific to each frame.

The information is transmitted as a RTP header extension as the RTP packet payload should be treated as opaque by the SFU.
This is especially necessary if the payload is end-to-end encrypted.
The amount of information should be limited to what is strictly necessary to the SFU task since it is not always as trusted as individual peers.

For audio, configuration information such as Opus TOC might be useful.
For video, the following configuration information might include:
- Stream configuration information: resolution, quality, frame rate...
- Codec specific configuration information: codec profile like profile_idc...
- Frame specific information: whether the stream is decodable when starting from this frame, whether the frame is skippable...

For video content, this information can be sent using a Dependency Descriptor header extension.
In that case, the first RTP packet of the frame will have its start_of_frame equal to 1 and the last packet will have its end_of_frame equal to 1.

SDP negotiation
=======================
Each video format will require a different payload type so they can be negotiated by both peers.

fmtp codec includes the FOURCC of the codec.

no need to negotiate the standard packetization for each coded, they are independent

rtx and fec are negotiated normally

Q: should we define what are the negotiated parameters for each codec? should we reuse mpeg/dash ones?
